        <p>Here at the AllForge, we believe collaboration leads to the best outcomes in all artistic pursuits. While other platforms may focus on monetizng cooperation as services rendered, our approach is to give artists of all media ways to connect with one another and create for the joy of doing so. While we encourage you to share freely with <a href="https://creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> licensing on your works, you may use the AllForge for projects you intend to monetize. Now get signed up if you haven't already, and get creating!</p>
